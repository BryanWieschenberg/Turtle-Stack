# Turtle Stack
## by Bryan Wieschenberg

This game was made in under 24 hours for the HackTCNJ 2025 Hackathon

* The game is about turtles and is a simple stacking game where the player must stack up turtles
* The player loses HP if a turtle falls off the screen or if the turtle misses the platform

## The player can stack turtles of different colors, each with their own unique properties
- Green turtles fall normally
- Blue turtles bounce off the platform once before being stackable
- Pink turtles quickly displace after falling a certain distance
- Orange turtles quickly come in from a low side instead of from the top of the screen
- Yellow turtles grant the player back HP, and are particularly hard to catch, but missing them has HP no penalty
- Red turtles spawn 2 falsely-colored clones around the real turtle, but only the real one can be caught
- Purple turtles will fade away as they fall

## WORK IN PROGRESS:
- Stacking functionality could not be implemented due to time constraints
- I will continue to work on this game and add this feature, among more, in the future
